# network-analysis
This project was coded in collaboratory with hadasar1, TamiKroizer and mirisinger to simulate working with a team. it was directed by Nvidia.

This is a web application for IT technicians that helps to map and visualizethe networks and devices deployed on clientsâ€™ locations.
This application plays a crucial role in identifying faulty devices, creating clearance about the
different devices networks and ensuring efficient service.
The application processes .cap files, which are essentially data files containing network information captured from devices.
By analyzing the data within these files, we gain valuable insights into the networks and devices, enabling to pinpoint potential issues and to help IT
experts map said networks.
In the end it shows an endpoint that when accessed via the browser with a certainnetwork id shows a dynamic page with some information about the requested
network and a visual representation of the connections in the network.
This was implemented using several Python libraries and SQL for DB.
